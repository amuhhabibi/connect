Thank you everyone for coming along. I am delighted to see you all. So it has been two weeks since our arrival here. Two weeks may sound like a very short time, well it is, but it was a very fun week filled with new experiences. Today, representing my friends, I am the one who’s going to give the farewell speech. I know that I don’t speak much either at school and at home, but that’s how I am, and I want you guys to know that even I the most quiet person still enjoy everything that we’ve done in the last two weeks.

It is really unfortunate to leave you guys and to leave Bendigo after what we’ve done.

At first, I expected to have more class than outside class, but it’s way more than I expected. We walk around the city. We went to an art gallery. We ride the talking tram. We went to the place where they fix the tram. We went to La Trobe Uni and learn a little bit of programming. We went to the Sacred Heart Cathedral. We went to a very big farm. Then we went to a primary school and teach them about Indonesia. Starting from how traditional Indonesian people dress, how to play a traditional Indonesian game, till a modern song in Indonesian. We’ve tasted a variety of food. And the most important thing, we’ve learnt so much since we’re here. Our English is improved drastically, especially our listening. When we first came to Aussie, we always think that everyone speaks much faster than we expected, and when people around us talk, we don’t understand. But after two weeks being in a native speakers house, we realised that there’s nothing wrong with the people, it’s just our hearing is not used to hearing native speaker talk.

And all this could happen with the help of a lot of people, starting from teachers who organise this program, teachers who help to do the activities of this program, host families who are willing to let strangers live at their house, buddies that’s willing to lead us on classes and other activities, and other people who participated on this program. We’re very thankful to you guys for doing all of this for us. We truly enjoy this past two weeks. We wish that our bond, not just our school, but every individual here will stay for eternity. Once again, big thank you for everything guys. Two thanks are not going to be enough to show our gratitude. We’re departing tomorrow to Sydney by bus. I think this is all from me. Good day.
