    <h2>CHAPTER 0</h2><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11 years after being born something forces him to change the way he sees the world. Even after that happens, he knew that as a kid his job is to have fun. So he pretended to have fun until 5 years later. He moved to another region because of his parents job. For a person who spent his whole life with the same person everyday, it'll be hard for him to make new friends. As an introvert he didn't think about getting a friend. Because he believes that there will be a time that an extrovert will adopt him.<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He graduated junior high with a narrow score, and also with a help of a family member he managed to enter a good highschool. Tho this may sound reasonable for a boy who spent almost his entire life playing video games, but what people don't know is that this is all according to his plan.<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 years ago, a friend ask him a quite confusing question. "Have you ever wonder about what you are if your mother didn't give birth to you". "Umm..". "Nevermind". After being confused by that question, unconciously he's been thinking about it until he realized that he is already home. Then the desire of wanting to know appear and leads him to a conclusion that he needs to find out the answer. So he decided to ask his friend tomorrow as soon as they met.<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the boy who ask him the question moved somewhere far due to a reason that the teacher won't tell us. From there and then, he sees the world as a scary place that is filled with unsolved questions.<br/><br/>
