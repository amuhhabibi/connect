                Dear Puspita,<br>
                on behalf of me and my cats, I extend our sincerest apologies if we gave you any bad experience during
                this year of 2021. A year of hard work has almost passed. I believe next year will again, come with it's
                own challenges and obstacles. Nonetheless, you really helped us a lot during this past year. We can't
                thank you enough for what you've done to us. We are really blessed to be able to know you as a person. We
                wish you courage, hope and faith to overcome all the obstacles that lies ahead. May we all have a great
                year and a wonderful time ahead. Let this new year be as good, or even better than the last one. Let
                this new year filled with happiness and warmth to even the most mundane days.
                <br><br>
                but..
 <br>
                As i'm writing this part, i realized that i've always been selfish. i've always talk only about myself, and never actually pay attention to u nor notice u. i only listen to ur stories sometimes and gave unthoughtful advices.  <br>
                it's unimaginable how much you've helped me throughout this year, and i've not yet said my thanks. in some days in this year, in a normal mundane day, a message from u cheers up my whole mood. idk how i felt that, but that might be my first few steps of falling in love. <br><br>
                after last night (the night of december 26th), i clearly know that im not a good listener. you were talking serious about your problem, but instead i couldn't even give any good advice or something. <br><br>
                when u said that u wanted to talk about something, i stopped what i was doing at that time. idk why, but at that moment, i don't wanna do anything except listening to you talking. but at the end, i don't think i helped u with anything. <br><br>
                my wish for the upcoming years is to be able to listen to your stories carefully, and actually give you meaningful advices <br>
                for us to be able to freely share our emotions. joy, sadness, anger, embarassment, hate, etc. <br>
                to help each other out. <br>
                to have problems, then solve it together. <br>
                i want to know u more, <br>
                and i want u to know me more. <br>
                i want us to understand each other, <br>
                and find the point, where we know, <br>
                that it's the right choice to have this relationship. <br>
 <br>
                May the best happens to everyone for the next whole year, <br>
                and let us be able wish the same on next year's new year's eve. <br>
                Cheers for you, me, the cats, and everyone. <br>
                 <br>
                Frohes Neues Jahr! <br>
